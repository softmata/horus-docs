# Rust Library

Pre-built components ready to use in your HORUS applications.

## [Built-in Nodes](/rust/library/built-in-nodes)

Hardware abstraction nodes for common robotics components:

- Sensors (IMU, GPS, Camera, LiDAR)
- Actuators (DC Motor, Servo, Stepper)
- Communication (CAN Bus, I2C, Serial)
- And more...

## [Algorithms](/rust/library/algorithms)

Robotics algorithms implemented and optimized:

- [PID Controller](/rust/library/algorithms/pid)
- [Kalman Filter](/rust/library/algorithms/kalman-filter)
- [A* Pathfinding](/rust/library/algorithms/astar)
- [Pure Pursuit](/rust/library/algorithms/pure-pursuit)
- And more...
