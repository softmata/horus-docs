# Sim3D - 3D Robotics Simulator

Sim3D is HORUS's high-fidelity 3D robotics simulator built on Bevy and Rapier3D physics. It provides realistic physics simulation, sensor emulation, and reinforcement learning environments for developing and testing robotic systems.

## Key Features

- **Physics Engine**: Rapier3D rigid and soft body dynamics
- **GPU Acceleration**: Optional GPU-accelerated physics and rendering
- **Sensor Suite**: 16+ sensor types (cameras, LiDAR, IMU, force/torque, etc.)
- **Robot Formats**: URDF, MJCF, SDF, USD support
- **RL Integration**: 6 built-in tasks with curriculum learning
- **Recording**: Trajectory and video recording/export
- **Editor**: Full scene editor with undo/redo

## Quick Start

```bash
# Run sim3d with a URDF robot
horus sim3d --robot models/robot.urdf --world configs/scene.yaml

# Headless mode for training
horus sim3d --headless --robot models/robot.urdf
```

## HORUS Integration

Sim3D automatically creates HORUS topics for robot control and sensor data:

| Topic | Type | Direction | Description |
|-------|------|-----------|-------------|
| `{robot}.cmd_vel` | Twist | Subscribe | Velocity commands |
| `{robot}.odom` | Odometry | Publish | Robot odometry |
| `{robot}.scan` | LaserScan | Publish | LiDAR scan |
| `{robot}.hf` | HFrameStamped | Publish | HFrame tree (transforms) |
| `{robot}.pointcloud` | PointCloud2 | Publish | 3D point cloud |
| `{robot}.joint_states` | JointState | Publish | Joint positions/velocities |

## Documentation Sections

- [Getting Started](/simulators/sim3d/getting-started/quick-start) - Installation and first simulation
- [Sensors](/simulators/sim3d/sensors/overview) - Camera, LiDAR, IMU, and more
- [Physics](/simulators/sim3d/physics/overview) - Rigid body, soft body, and GPU physics
- [Reinforcement Learning](/simulators/sim3d/rl/overview) - RL tasks and training

## System Requirements

| Component | Minimum | Recommended |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| CPU | 4 cores | 8+ cores |
| RAM | 8 GB | 16+ GB |
| GPU | OpenGL 3.3 | Vulkan/CUDA capable |
| Storage | 2 GB | 10+ GB (with assets) |

## Feature Flags

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `visual` | Full 3D rendering (default) |
| `headless` | No rendering, for training |
| `editor` | Scene editor UI |
| `python` | Python bindings for RL training |
| `full` | All features combined |

### Enabling Features

**Option 1: Command-line flag (recommended)**

```bash
horus run --enable python,editor
```

**Option 2: Explicit in horus.yaml**

```yaml
enable:
  - python
  - editor
```

Then run:
```bash
horus sim3d
```

**Option 3: Manual Cargo.toml (for cargo projects)**

If using `cargo` directly:

```toml
[dependencies]
sim3d = { version = "0.1", features = ["python", "editor"] }
```

```bash
cargo run -p sim3d --features "python,editor"
```
