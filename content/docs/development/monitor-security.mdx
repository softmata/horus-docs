# Monitor Security

The HORUS monitor supports password-based authentication for networked deployments.

## Setup

On first run, set a password (or press Enter to skip):

```bash
horus monitor

[SECURITY] HORUS Monitor - First Time Setup
Password: ********
Confirm password: ********
[SUCCESS] Password set successfully!
```

Reset password anytime with:

```bash
horus monitor -r
```

## API Authentication

```bash
# Login
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"password": "your_password"}'
# Returns: {"token": "abc123..."}

# Use token for requests
curl http://localhost:3000/api/nodes \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer abc123..."
```

## Security Details

| Feature | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Password hashing | Argon2id |
| Session timeout | 1 hour inactivity |
| Rate limiting | 5 attempts per 60 seconds |
| Token size | 256-bit random |

Password hash stored at `~/.horus/monitor_password.hash`.

## Network Access

```bash
# Local only (default)
horus monitor

# Allow network access (set password first!)
horus monitor --host 0.0.0.0
```

For production, use a reverse proxy with TLS.

## Recovery

If locked out:

```bash
rm ~/.horus/monitor_password.hash
horus monitor  # Re-prompts for password
```
